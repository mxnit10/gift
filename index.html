            <p class="quote"> </p> Hey Rudranshi </p>
Life can be rough, you know? Sometimes it feels like everything's coming at you at once. But here's the thing, I wouldn't want to face it all without you by my side.</p>
You're more than just a best friend, you're like... well, you're the one person I can always count on, no matter what. You crack me up, you keep me real, and you're always down to just hang out, even if we're doing nothing. </p>
Whatever life throws our way, we'll face it together. We'll celebrate the good times, pick each other up when things are tough, and maybe even have some funny stories to look back on later.  You know I'm always here to chat, whenever you need someone to talk to.</p>
Seriously, our conversations are the best. I could literally talk to you for hours, just shooting the breeze and laughing about whatever. Even if it's just a quick chat every few days, it brightens my whole week. 
There's something you might not even know...  Sometimes I worry that we might have a fight or something and mess things up, you know? But then I remember this message you sent me on July 13th. It might seem like nothing to you, but it means the world to me. It reminds me why our friendship is so special.</p>
Listen, even if things ever change between us, that's okay. I'm just grateful to have you as a friend, and I'll always cherish the memories we've made.
Seriously though, you're amazing, Rudranshi. You light up the room, you're strong and supportive, and anyone who gets to be your best friend is super lucky. </p>
Here's to our friendship! It might only feel like 1.2 years, but it feels like I've known you since ages....... All I wanted to say is thanks for everything you gave me and this bond. I really appreciate you and will never take any of this for granted and will always put my 101% efforts to keep this bond alive in any situation! 
Thanks!</p>
And hey, if you ever need someone to talk to, you know where to find me.  Always happy to lend an ear, no matter what.  Just sayin'. 
Plus, you're just hilarious. You always know how to make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down. And you're a great listener, too. I can always count on you to be there for me, no matter what.  You're one of a kind, Rudranshi. Thanks for being you. </p>

Maybe tonight or even tomorrow, Tuesday, whenever works for you. It's about that diary I've been meaning to show you. Man, it's been three months now, and every single day I've been hoping to hear from you, but time just keeps ticking away. I know you've got your own things going on, but if you could just find a little time to flip through it and shoot me your thoughts, that would be awesome. Seriously, it would mean a lot to me.</p>
